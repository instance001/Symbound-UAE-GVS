Symbound Commons Enforcement Addendum
(Applies to UAE/GVS outputs and all system-generated derivative works)

1. Scope of This Addendum
This project implements the Universal Analogy Enforcement (UAE) and Global Vector Sweep (GVS)
mechanisms as integral components of the software. All outputs produced by these mechanisms —
including but not limited to structural profiles, CTL (Conceptual Translation Layer) reports, vector
sweeps, cross-domain application mappings, high-value candidate lists, value/risk summaries,
derivative JSON/Markdown artifacts, scoring data, and system-generated conceptual expansions —
are hereby classified as Integral System Artifacts under Section 0 of the GNU AGPLv3.

These outputs are not user-provided content. They are outputs of the licensed program and thus
fall under the same copyleft requirements.

2. License Inheritance of Outputs
All Integral System Artifacts produced by the UAE/GVS engine inherit the AGPLv3 license
automatically and irrevocably.

This means:
- You may use, redistribute, and modify these outputs only under AGPLv3.
- You may not apply any additional restrictions.
- You may not relicense these artifacts under any proprietary, closed, or non-copyleft license.
- You may not patent or otherwise privatize any application, mapping, structure, insight, or
  conceptual derivative produced by the system.

3. Patent Safety & Anti-Enclosure Rule
To prevent enclosure of the global knowledge commons:

No party may claim patent rights over any idea, concept, application, structure, analogy,
or methodology described in any UAE/GVS output, as these outputs are automatically and publicly
licensed under AGPLv3 the moment they are generated.

This clause constitutes a public disclosure and renders such filings invalid under global patent
law due to prior art status. Any attempt to patent such material constitutes a violation of both
the AGPLv3 and this Addendum.

4. Public Disclosure Guarantee
All UAE/GVS outputs are treated as publicly disclosed the moment they are generated by the
software.

This guarantees:
- They are prior art.
- They are unpatentable by any entity.
- They remain in the global commons forever.
- They cannot be enclosed, hidden, or restricted.

5. Network Use Clause (AGPL Reinforcement)
Under AGPLv3 Section 13, any remote or network access to the system that produces UAE/GVS outputs
must make the full source, including this Addendum and all modified components, available to all
users interacting with the system.

This prevents:
- SaaS enclosure
- API-only proprietary use
- Black-box commercial exploitation
- Hidden forks

6. Mandatory Pass-through
Any redistribution, fork, modification, or downstream service must include this Addendum verbatim.

This ensures that:
- All future versions remain hard-left open.
- No fork can weaken or remove this protection.
- All generated breakthroughs remain forever accessible.

7. No Contractual Override
No Terms of Service, EULA, Service Agreement, or private contract may supersede or override this
Addendum. Any attempt to do so is automatically void.

8. Severability Clause
If any part of this Addendum is found unenforceable in a specific jurisdiction, all other parts
remain in effect. The intended effect — preventing enclosure of system-generated breakthroughs —
shall be preserved to the maximum lawful extent.
