Symbound UAE/GVS is an open, commons-licensed reasoning framework that helps humans explore the full implication space of any idea.

It does not create new science, bypass safety, or operate autonomously. It maps:
- an idea’s properties
- the domains those properties appear in
- analogous uses
- overlaps and adjacent fields
- blind spots the human may not know
- safe, structured cross-domain vectors

Humans remain the source of novelty. The system removes friction and reveals more of the landscape.

UAE/GVS is:
- safe
- transparent
- structured
- bounded
- commons-locked

Its purpose:
Make discovery accessible to everyone, not just institutions.
