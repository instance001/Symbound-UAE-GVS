# Symbound UAE/GVS Engine – Core Repository

**Universal Analogy Enforcement (UAE)** + **Global Vector Sweep (GVS)**

This repository defines and implements the Symbound UAE/GVS engine:

- A structural profiling layer for concepts and systems.
- A Global Vector Sweep (GVS) that forces cross-domain, cross-scale analogy search.
- A Conceptual Translation Layer (CTL) that turns local ideas into global application maps.
- A Modest Cognition Model (MCM) scoring layer that filters for high-value, low-risk candidates.

Most importantly, this repo also defines the **legal doctrine** that:

> If the machine finds it, humanity owns it.

All UAE/GVS outputs are:

- Classified as **Integral System Artifacts**.
- Automatically licensed under **AGPL-3.0-or-later**.
- Treated as **public prior art** upon creation.
- Permanently **unpatentable** and **non-enclosable**.

## Repo Layout

- `LICENSE` – AGPL-3.0-or-later pointer.
- `LICENSE_ADDENDUM_SYMBOUND_COMMONS.txt` – Symbound Commons Enforcement Addendum.
- `docs/LEGAL/` – legal doctrine, prior-art explainer, and SPLL manifesto.
- `schemas/` – JSON schemas for structural profiles and CTL reports.
- `prompts/` – Foreman system and task prompts for GVS.
- `scripts/` – helper scripts for profile generation, scoring, and report stamping.
- `.github/workflows/` – SPDX and Output Notice enforcement.

## Usage

This repository is designed to be:

- A **standalone legal and cognitive engine**.
- A canonical reference for UAE/GVS definitions and outputs.
- A drop-in submodule or dependency for systems like Chatty, Janet, Venom, etc.

Any implementation (direct or indirect) of UAE/GVS-class reasoning that produces outputs fitting
the defined schemas and categories is expected to respect:

- The AGPL-3.0-or-later license.
- The Symbound Commons Enforcement Addendum.
- The Symbound Public License Layer (SPLL).
