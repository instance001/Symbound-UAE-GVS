UAE (Universal Analogy Engine) and GVS (Global Vector Sweep) define a structured reasoning protocol with:

Determinism: fixed analogical rules.
Non-creativity: no hypothesis generation.
Property-driven mapping.
Cross-domain expansion.
Value-scoring.
Commons-locked outputs.

The system reorganizes existing knowledge using structural analogy and property mapping. It does not invent new mechanisms. Outputs are public prior art via AGPLv3 + Symbound Addendum.
